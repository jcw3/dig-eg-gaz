I'm working on the week of May 29 to June 3.
For the record, with the uploads of May 29, and May31- June 3's page 3's, the file names mistakingly call them, for instance, May 31 instead of May 31 p. 3. Please take that into account when reviewing the files.

EDIT 10/1/2016: Of the xml files, May 29 is mostly finished entirely as an issue. There are some problems with the ads/boilerplates. May 30-June 3 all have finished page 3's, with minor irregularities in boilerplates/ads.
