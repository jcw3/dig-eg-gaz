BIG LOCAL COMBINE

The Associated Cottonginners of Egypt

A great combine of the cotton ginners of Egypt has lately been formed.
We give below particulars of the company, which is entitled the Associated
Cotton Ginners of Egypt, Limited. All the great ginners in Egypt have joined
the combine, and it promises to be one of the most powerful industrial
organizations in the country.
The whole concern was valued at double the capital as given below.
Subsequently it was decided to reduce the estimate on which this was based by
one half, each factory being paid by an equivalent in shares. The Egyptian
Investment and Agency, Limited, intend offering 75,000 one-pound shares at a
premium of one-pound to their shareholders and friends.
There are other ginning factories taken over besides those mentioned below,
which are only the chief concerns. Nearly all the banks are interested in the
company, which is destined to occupy as high a position in ginning as the
Societe de Pressage et des Depets does in pressing. There will probably be a
limited public subscription in about ten days' time.
This combine will be of great advantage in regard to the financial equilibrium of industrial Egypt. Often the position of up-country ginners with little capital has caused a good deal of nervousness to the banks, but all this anxiety will be obviated by the combine, which will develop so as the course of time to gin in all the centres, and will have a virtual monopoly of this business throughout Egypt.
The following are the details of the registration :
Associated Cotton Ginners of Egypt, Limited. - Registered May 17th, by Worthington, Evans and Co., 27, Nicholas Lane, E.C. Capital, 360,000 pounds in 1 pound shares.

DEATH OF MRS. BALBI.
We deeply regret to announce the death of Mrs. Eileen Balbi, the wife of Major H.A. Balbi, R.M.A., who died at Malta on Saturday week (20th May) after a brief illness. The funeral, which was strictly private, took place yesterday week. Mrs. Balbi was the daughter of Fleet Surgeon McDermott, R.N. She had only left Alexandria with the Royal Malta Artillery, which her husband commanded, a few weeks ago, and during her residence in Egypt had made a large number of friends, to whom the sad news of her untimely end will come as a great shock, as the deceased left Egypt in apparently the best of health. The following sympathetic notice is extracted from the �Malta Chronicle�:--
�The death of Mrs. Balbi has brought a heavy weight of grief, not only upon Mrs. Balbi, but upon a large number of the inhabitants of Malta, to whom the deceased lady was well-known and by whom she was greatly respected.
�In Egypt too many will learn with astonishment and sorrow that Mrs. Balbi, who had helped to make the long days in a foreign land pass with less weariness to the English and Maltan community there, and who lent herself willingly to the forwarding of good works of a permanent nature, is no more.
�It is yet but a short time since Major and Mrs. Balbi returned to Malta along with the contingent of the R.M.A. which had done duty there. There was nothing to cause the fear that her days would so quickly end. Still there is gloom now where her presence brought brightness!
�The recentness of the deceased lady�s return to this island, her comparative youth, the shortness of her illness, have all combined to impress her friends and acquaintances, and to awake a deep sympathy with those who now most mourn her loss.�

NILE NAVIGATION

NEW COMPANY FORMED

The possibilities of the development of Nile navigation are immense, and there appears to be a good opening for the new Bus-Bost Company (Compagnie des Bateaux-Omnibus) which has just been founded. The objects of the new company are the transport of persons, goods, cattle, etc., by waterway in Egypt and all other enterprises subsidiary thereto. The company declares that it recognizes retrospectively the concession granted to Messrs. Ad. Cattaui and Co. by the Egyptian Government for the construction of pontoons on the two banks of the Nile between Old Cairo and Rod el-Farag, and of the conventions  made by the same firm with Messrs. Thos. Cook and Son (Egypt), Limited, and the Anglo-American Nile Steamers and Hotel Company, Limited. The capital is L.E. 10,000 in 2,500 shares of L.E. 4 each. It has already been subscribed and the following persons have taken up the undermentioned amount of shares �

Messrs. Ad. Cattani and Co., 1800, Ad. Cattaui, 100, Gustave Cattaui, 100, Alfred de Menasoe, 100, Dario Finzi, 100, Pani Oziol, 100, Robert S. Rolo, 100, Andre Suares, 100. These gentlemen will form the board of directors.

A PROSPEROUS COMPANY.

To-morrow the annual general meeting of the Anglo-American Nile Steamers and Hotels Company will be held at Cairo, when a very satisfactory statement of this company�s progress will be placed before the shareholders. We understand that 35,000 pound six per cent debentures are to be redeemed, and besides a dividend of eight per cent will be given, making a total of nine per cent.
The company has been so successful this year that all the preliminary expenses, which amounted to nearly 3000 pounds, are to be written of, and 10000 pounds will be placed to the reserve, bringing the reserve fund up to about 12,000, and leaving about 2700 pounds to be carried forward to the profit and loss account for next year.

THE SUEZ CANAL COMPANY.

At the meeting of the council of the Suez Canal Company held on the 22nd inst., the dividend on the ordinary shares for the year 1904 was fixed at 141fr. (5 pounds 12s. 9d.) net, free of taxes, equivalent to a little more than 28 per cent on the 500 fr. shares. Mr. T.W. Hughes, the managing director of the Harrison Line, of Liverpool, was at the same time nominated as a British administrator in the place of Mr. J.B. Westray, who has resigned.
It is believed that the transit dues will be reduced from 8fr.50c. To 7fr.75c from January 1 next, in consequence of the increase in the receipts.
The dividends for 1904 to be distributed by the company include the following:--O shares �de jouissance,� fr. 117.447:, and on founder�s shares, fr. 66.57, both net.

THE LOCUST VISITATION

Mr. Machell left Cairo last Thursday and proceeded to Maghagha, where the larger flights of locusts have been observed, in order to personally inspect this part of the country and to find out if any damage had been done, and to what extent the locusts had laid eggs. He found, however, that although a considerable number of locusts had slighted in these spots, they had almost entirely disappeared, and that very few eggs had been laid.
Owing to the prevalence of N. to N.E. winds there is very little fear of a recurrence of the plague from which the country suffered last year.

THE PLAGUE

Eight cases of plague have been notified in Egypt since the 21st inst., viz, 2 at Mi-Ghamr, 3 at Menouf, 2 at Port Said, and 1 at Alexandria. One death from Plague was reported esterday from Damanhour and also 1 from Menouf. There are now eight cases under treatment.

SUSPECTED PLAGUE ON SHIP

The English steamer �Van Colquhoun,� which left Bombay on the 12th inst., arrived at Suez on Friday last with a case of suspected plague aboard. Dr. Vay stated that on examination he found that the patient was suffering from a bubo in the left femoral region. There was no doctor on board the vessel but the capital informed Dr. Vay that the patient, who is an Indian, fell ill four days after leaving Bombay and that for three days his temperature was 40 to 40.5 Centigrade, after which he gradually improved, and his condition is now satisfactory. After disinfection the vessel was allowed to proceed through the canal in quarantine.

CATTLE PLAGUE

During the week ending 27th inst., three deaths from cattle plague were notified, vis., 2 at Hehis, province of Charkieh, and 1 at Ghizeh. The number of deaths during the corresponding period last year was 5,43. Between the 21st and 27th May 1,156 animals were inoculated.
Since the commencement of the epidemic the total number of deaths amounts to 147, 212, distributed as follows:- Gouvernorate 892, Lower Egypt 54,089, Upper Egypt 92,381.
